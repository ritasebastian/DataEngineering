## Setting Up Visual Studio Code for SSH Access to AWS EC2 Instance

### 1. Install Visual Studio Code (VSC):

   Download and install Visual Studio Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), ensuring it's installed on your laptop.

### 2. Create an AWS EC2 Instance:

   Set up an AWS EC2 instance and open port 22 to enable SSH access.

### 3. Install "Remote SSH" Extension:

   - Open Visual Studio Code.
   - Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
   - Search for "Remote - SSH" extension and install it.

### 4. Configure SSH Connection:

   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette.
   - Type "Remote-SSH: Open Configuration File" and press Enter.
   - This will take you to the folder where SSH configurations are stored (e.g., `/Users/your_username/.ssh` on macOS).
   - Edit the `config` file and add the following configuration:

   ```ssh
   Host my-ec2
     HostName 54.184.85.157
     IdentityFile "/Users/ssantiago/Downloads/2024-oregan.pem"
     User ec2-user
     Port 22

Connect to EC2 Instance:
Open Visual Studio Code.
Press Ctrl+Shift+P to open the command palette.
Type "Remote-SSH: Connect to Host..." and select the host you defined in the config file (e.g., "my-ec2").
Visual Studio Code will connect to your EC2 instance via SSH.
