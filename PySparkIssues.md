Here are some real-time issues faced while using **PySpark in data pipelines**, along with their resolutions:

---

### **1. Performance Bottlenecks (Slow Execution)**
**Issue:**  
- Long execution times due to inefficient transformations (e.g., using `groupBy()` instead of `reduceByKey()`).
- Too many `collect()` operations causing driver memory overflow.

**Resolution:**
- Use `cache()` or `persist()` to store intermediate results.
- Optimize transformations (`reduceByKey()` is better than `groupByKey()`).
- Use **broadcast variables** for small lookup datasets.
- Avoid `collect()` unless necessary.

---

### **2. Skewed Data (Uneven Partitioning)**
**Issue:**  
- Certain partitions are much larger than others, causing slow processing.
- Some tasks finish quickly, while others take too long.

**Resolution:**
- Use **salting** (adding random prefixes to keys before aggregation).
- Use **repartition() or coalesce()** to distribute data more evenly.
- Implement **custom partitioning** in `RDD.partitionBy()` or `DataFrame.repartition()`.

---

### **3. High Shuffle Costs**
**Issue:**  
- Too many shuffle operations (`groupBy()`, `join()`, `distinct()`, etc.), leading to increased execution time and memory usage.

**Resolution:**
- Use `map-side join` by broadcasting small datasets (`broadcast(df)`).
- Reduce `groupBy()` operations and use `reduceByKey()`, `aggregateByKey()`, or `mapPartitions()`.
- Increase shuffle partitions (`spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`).

---

### **4. Memory Issues (Out of Memory - OOM)**
**Issue:**  
- Driver or executor crashes due to insufficient memory.
- Heavy data processing in memory-intensive operations like `collect()`.

**Resolution:**
- Increase `executor.memory` and `driver.memory` in Spark configurations.
- Use **columnar storage** (Parquet, ORC) instead of CSV.
- Optimize **Garbage Collection (GC)** settings.

---

### **5. Data Loss in Streaming Pipelines**
**Issue:**  
- Streaming jobs fail, causing lost data.
- Kafka or Kinesis consumer offsets not being committed correctly.

**Resolution:**
- Enable **checkpointing** (`df.writeStream.option("checkpointLocation", path)`).
- Use **idempotent operations** (avoid duplicates).
- Store offsets manually in external storage (e.g., Delta Lake, PostgreSQL).

---

### **6. Schema Evolution Issues**
**Issue:**  
- Schema changes (adding or removing columns) cause job failures.

**Resolution:**
- Use **mergeSchema=True** while reading Parquet (`spark.read.option("mergeSchema", "true")`).
- Handle missing columns by providing **default values** (`df.fillna()`).
- Implement **versioning** in data storage.

---

### **7. Small Files Problem in HDFS or S3**
**Issue:**  
- Too many small files degrade performance.
- S3 or HDFS struggles with millions of small files.

**Resolution:**
- Use `df.coalesce(N)` before writing.
- Store data in **Parquet** instead of CSV.
- Implement **Compaction Jobs** (merge small files periodically).

---

### **8. Job Failures Due to YARN or Kubernetes Resource Limits**
**Issue:**  
- Executors get killed due to exceeding memory limits.
- Jobs get stuck in the pending state due to resource constraints.

**Resolution:**
- Use `dynamic allocation` (`spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled = true`).
- Increase `executor.memory` and `executor.cores` settings.
- Adjust **queue configurations** in YARN or Kubernetes.

---

### **9. PySpark UDF Performance Issues**
**Issue:**  
- UDFs (`udf()`) are slow because they run row-by-row (Python overhead).

**Resolution:**
- Use **pandas UDFs** (`@pandas_udf`) instead of regular UDFs.
- Prefer **built-in Spark SQL functions** over UDFs.
- Convert operations to **Scala UDFs** if performance is critical.

---

### **10. Serialization Issues**
**Issue:**  
- Spark throws `PicklingError` or `java.io.NotSerializableException`.

**Resolution:**
- Use `broadcast()` for large objects.
- Ensure **functions and variables used inside RDD transformations are serializable**.
- Prefer **DataFrames over RDDs** to avoid serialization overhead.
