Several platforms offer opportunities to practice PySpark coding for interviews:

1. Spark Playground (sparkplayground.com): This platform provides hands-on coding questions specifically designed for PySpark interview preparation. It offers an online compiler, tutorials, and real-world interview questions[1].

2. GeekCoders: They offer a course with 50 PySpark interview questions, covering a range of topics from beginner to advanced levels. The course includes detailed explanations and solutions[2][3].

3. StrataScratch: This platform provides LeetCode-style questions for various SQL flavors, including PySpark[4].

4. DataCamp: They offer a comprehensive guide with 30 PySpark interview questions and answers, covering both basic and advanced topics[5].

5. DevSkiller: This platform offers coding tests for PySpark, including choice questions, code gaps, and programming tasks designed to assess Big Data and PySpark skills[6].

6. ZillaCode: While not extensively reviewed, this platform has been mentioned as a potential resource for data engineering-centric interview preparation, including PySpark[4].

It's important to note that while these platforms offer valuable practice opportunities, some interviewers suggest that PySpark questions in actual interviews often focus more on knowledge of Spark concepts rather than practical coding, as interview environments may not always support running PySpark code[4].
